# Student-Recruitment-System

In their pursuit of higher education, many students decide to enroll in courses offered by 
prestigious universities. However, a select few individuals might decide to pursue their field of 
interest at a respected university with reasonable tuition. Student Recruitment System is a database 
that provides access to this data to assist students in selecting their majors and educational 
institutions.
We are employing ORM (Object-Role-Model) representation in the initial stages of our 
project, which effectively conveys domain concepts to a stakeholder through graphical 
representations of the necessary model's entities and attributes. We are modeling the Student 
Recruitment System in this project. The relational view of NORMA is used to map the ORM 
schemas to relational database schemas based on the obtained ORM representation of the 
application, and the database tables are visually represented in the relational schema. In general, it 
acts as a template for the real database, demonstrating how the data is arranged into tables.
The relational schema, which supports all SQL databases, can be used to create SQL code. 
The database tables for our project were built using column constraints, such as Primary Key, 
Foreign Key, and NOT NULL constraints. We used triggers, stored procedures, and a few more 
straightforward queries depending on the information that students required to make the best 
selections. In addition, we use Couchbase Server, a distributed open-source package for connected 
apps. It is possible to create, collect, and retrieve data. Our own database, which we are using, has 
a variety of Student details, courses, universities, and a few more categories.
