# Student-Recruitment-System

Students may build a profile using the information in the database, then start exploring for colleges 
that match that profile. If they find a university that fits their profile, they may apply and check the 
status of their acceptance. Students may use the database to monitor their admissions progress and 
decide whether they need to submit applications to additional universities or not. This database 
might be incredibly useful to a student because it maintains track of every little detail, including a
student's profile, university information, and admission status.

Conclusion
We think that any student who wishes to enroll in the best universities would find our project 
useful based on their profile and prerequisites. In order for other students to compare them and get 
a sense of the kinds of colleges they could be accepted to, students can join up for this site, establish 
profiles, and fill them up with information about their educational experience, career history, and 
test scores. As a result of the independent construction of this database, we are now only able to 
give data on institutions in the United States and it also helps for the immigration students.
Applicants can update their profiles on the universities' application status by searching up
the data for all the schools, validating the tuition prices, acceptance rates, and courses offered, in 
order to make the information relevant to other students. Although there are applications like these, 
recent observations of how this entire process operates by students have revealed that there are 
still a lot of unsolved questions. In this project, we will try to answer a few of these questions. We 
gained a good comprehension of the principles by applying them to data structures, and we were 
able to tie the ideas presented as part of the project to real-world scenarios.

NoSQL databases also have the advantage of being easily scalable, just as SQL databases do. In 
contrast, NoSQL databases scale horizontally, meaning that they can run on more servers. As a 
result, NoSQL is better suited to applications with a large and more powerful database.
